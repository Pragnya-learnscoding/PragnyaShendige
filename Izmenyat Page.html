                <p>As Indian citizens and as high school graduates, we always observed the teaching in our education system did not always meet it’s mark. So decided to try a different approach, an approach that makes children visualise the war, it’s political strategy, causes and impact.</p>

                        <p>History is a subject full of stories and events that have proven difficult for students to learn. Moreover, most students choose to learn Science or Commerce over Social Studies after their 10th grade, and we wanted to know why. Hence, we have chosen the chapters in History of Class 9 and 10.</p>

                    <div class="playtesting-column">
                        <p>We circulated an initial survey that listed down Chapters from class 9 and 10 respectively, and asked students to choose what they found the toughest among them in the respective classes. Finally, we asked students to choose the toughest chapter from both classes, and yet, class 9 chapter ‘Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution’ won the majority vote.</p>

                        <p>At the game's outset, players are secretly assigned to either the White Army or the Red Army, with roles unveiled later. Players distribute resource tokens following the action card's order, gaining allies until they draw a fellowship card. During this critical phase, chance determines ally gain or loss. After special events
                            conclude, eliminated players, based on acquired allies, enter a bidding round, hiding manifestos in the White Palace.</p>
